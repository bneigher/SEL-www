        <p class="lead">
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggini/" target="_blank">Gabriella Gini</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">Sophie Karrow</a>, and <a href="" target="_blank">Rebekka Schaffer</a> are three young women who met in the Obama Foundationâ€™s
          2019 Community Leadership Corps. Brought together by their shared passion for education equity and Social
          Emotional Learning, the team committed the next 5 months to identifying a problem, creating a solution, and
          working alongside community members in the South Side of Chicago every step of the way.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The identified problem is this: Underserved students need an environment that creates a sense of community,
          affirmation, and safety (emotional, physical, etc.) in their schools because schools as institutions were
          designed to reinforce dominant group ideology and lack feedback from the students they serve.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">

          The goal of this team was to develop a curriculum to share with Chicago teachers to aide them in opening up a
          dialogue with their students regarding their classroom environment. Ultimately, the team wants to elevate the
          student voice and make students co-creators in their classroom environment. They created this website to hold
          a collection of resources and stories of teachers who have used those resources to gather feedback from
          students and implement positive change in their classroom.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          This site is not a reflection of Gabriella, Sophie, and Rebekka--it is a reflection of a broad and diverse
          community dedicated to seeing Chicago students thrive, excel, and succeed.
